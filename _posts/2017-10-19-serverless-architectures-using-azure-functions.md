## Techdays 2017

A few weeks ago I was presented with a fantastic opportunity, to speak at the biggest Microsoft conference in the Netherlands, TechDays 2017. The session was about my favorite subjects nowadays, serverless architectures and Azure Functions.

Below you can find my slides of this session and a link to the demo I made.

## So long, and thanks for all the fish!

I had a great time at TechDays, I enjoyed speaking as well as attending numerous great sessions. It was a lot of fun being there with all my colleagues.

At the end of the conference the two fish which were present at our Xpirit stand did not have a place to go, so I decided to adopt them :).
