## Sitecore MVP Summit Miami

This week more than 60 Sitecore MVPs from 10 different countries will attend the first global [Sitecore MVP](http://sitecoremvpsummit.net/) summit. I consider myself very fortunate to be one of them :).

There are quite a few Dutch MVPs and many of them are able to join the summit in Miami. For the non-Dutch MVPs who are attending, I'm pretty sure you'll be able to recognize us ;). (Make sure to check [#sitecoremvpsummit](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sitecoremvpsummit) on Twitter the next few days!).

## Travel &amp; learn

Since I'll be spending quite some time travelling from The Netherlands to the US I thought I can use this time efficiently and catch up with some of the latest software engineering & .Net development news by listening to podcasts. So I installed [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict) (for Android) on my phone and added the following feeds:

- [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/)
- [HanselMinutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/)
- [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/)
- [Agile Weekly](http://integrumtech.com/category/agile-weekly-podcast/)
- [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Feeds/RSS)

Unfortunately I didn't find any active Sitecore related feeds (there used to be one on [http://learnsitecore.cmsuniverse.net](http://learnsitecore.cmsuniverse.net/)). What I did find was a post describing [how to build a podcast feed in Sitecore](http://ihuangsitecore.blogspot.nl/2013/06/sitecore-podcast-feed.html).

# Sitecore dev news

If you want to stay up to date on the latest Sitecore development topics you really need to subscribe to the [Sitecore Basics Weekly Newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/sitecorebasics) (an excellent initiative by [Kiran Patil](https://twitter.com/kiranpatils)). In addition it is very useful (and great fun) to watch the [Sitecore 7 videos on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/SitecorePM) or watch them live on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+sitecore/posts).
