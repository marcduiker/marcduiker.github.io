## Human Interaction Pattern

This is the fourth part of the Durable Functions series where I look into the `DurableOrchestrationClient`. In the video I'll talk about the Human Interaction pattern, which deals with raising events from the client and waiting for events in the orchestrator.

Here's the video, please give it a thumbs up if you like it and subscribe to my channel so you'll be notified of new videos.
