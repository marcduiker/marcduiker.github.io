## Durable Functions Videos

I've decided to create some video's to explain and demonstrate the [Durable Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-overview) framework.

The first video covers a very basic 'Hello World' example and shows how to use the `OrchestrationClient` and `DurableOrchestrationContext` objects.

Here's the video, please give it a thumbs up if you like it and subscribe to my channel so you'll be notified of new videos.
